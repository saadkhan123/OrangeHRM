Selenium and Rest Assured Tests:

After performing exploratory testing, I proceeded with UI automation based on the provided requirements. I built a Selenium–Rest Assured hybrid framework using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to ensure maintainability and scalability. I covered all the necessary UI and API test cases.

To clearly differentiate between the UI and API results, I split the test reports accordingly—providing separate reports for UI and API testing. I configured testng.xml to run tests in parallel, where UI tests execute first followed by API tests. Upon completion, a consolidated report is generated with detailed logs for both UI and API test executions.


Playwright Tests:

Using the same URL and test scenarios as in the Selenium suite, I developed a Playwright project in Visual Studio Code using JavaScript. I replicated the required test coverage with proper assertions and validations, ensuring consistency between the Selenium and Playwright implementations.
